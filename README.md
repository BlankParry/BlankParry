  ### KindRipple
  <p>A comprehensive food donation platform built with <b>React Native</b> and <b>Supabase</b>. KindRipple connects restaurants with surplus food to NGOs and volunteers, creating an efficient ecosystem to reduce food waste. It features a modern, role-based design and supports real-time tracking, volunteer coordination, and impact analytics. This project showcases my skills in full-stack development, database design, and mobile app architecture.</p>

  ### Interactive Learning Assistant in Unity
  <p>An interactive learning application that features a chatbot character model from Char.ai to guide users through lessons. I designed an intuitive interface and integrated a conversational AI with voice and text capabilities to provide detailed explanations and answer user queries.</p>

  ### Public Grievance Redressal System
  <p>I designed and implemented a scalable database system using MySQL to efficiently manage public grievances. The database design was normalized to 3NF, reducing redundancy and optimizing performance for cloud-hosted deployment.</p>
