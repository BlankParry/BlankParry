üöÄ Featured Projects
KindRipple : A comprehensive food donation platform built with React Native and Supabase. KindRipple connects restaurants with surplus food to NGOs and volunteers, creating an efficient ecosystem to reduce food waste. It features a modern, role-based design and supports real-time tracking, volunteer coordination, and impact analytics. This project showcases my skills in full-stack development, database design, and mobile app architecture. 


Interactive Learning Assistant in Unity: An interactive learning application that features a chatbot character model from Char.ai to guide users through lessons. I designed an intuitive interface and integrated a conversational AI with voice and text capabilities to provide detailed explanations and answer user queries. 

Public Grievance Redressal System: We designed and implemented a scalable database system using MySQL to efficiently manage public grievances. The database design was normalized appropriately in order to minimize redundancy and optimize performance for cloud-hosted deployment.
